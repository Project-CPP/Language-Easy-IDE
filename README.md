## Syntax Coming Soon.

## What I ask of you.
Feel free to use Language-Easy in your C++ projects and feel free to fork and build more out of this. All I ask... PLEASE FORK... DON'T COPY WITHOUT SHOWING WHO HAS CREATED WHAT... This way people can see your work toward someone else's work. People will look down on you for not doing that. Github keeps records on who created it first. So go figure on that, if you are a thief. Otherwise feel free to take advantage of what I put out there for you!
